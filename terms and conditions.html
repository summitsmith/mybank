If the registered seal is lost, or if the registered seal or signature (or its font type) is to be changed, or if there is any change in the name, home address, telephone number, occupation, purpose of transactions, email address, or other registered information, the customer shall immediately notify the Bank. The Bank shall not be liable for any damage arising before the Bank’s receipt of such notice due to the customer’s failure of or delay in giving such notice. A notice regarding the information registered for a customer shall be received by the method prescribed by the Bank and accepted as of the date on which the Bank completes the registration process. If the customer has lost the registered seal, or if the customer forgets the registered signature, or if a customer is unable to put the registered signature under any other circumstances, the customer’s Account shall be terminated following the relevant procedure taken as prescribed by the Bank. In such cases, the Bank may ask the customer to appoint a guarantor within a reasonable period of time. If the customer forgets the registered signature, no inquiries regarding the said signature will be accepted, and the customer shall be required to register a new signature by the method prescribed by the Bank. The Bank shall not be liable for any damage that may be incurred by the customer due to the Bank’s rejection of inquiries regarding the customer’s registered signature.
